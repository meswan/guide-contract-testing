NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to test Java microservices with consumer driven contracts in Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

With microservices-based architecture, there is a need for robust testing to ensure that microservices that depend on one another are able to communicate effectively.
Typically, to prevent multiple points of failures at different integration points, a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are used.
While unit tests are fast, they are less trustworthy as they run in isolation and usually rely on mock data.

Integration tests address this issue by testing against real running services. However, they tend to be slow as the tests depend on other microservices and are less reliable as they are prone to external changes.

Usually, end-to-end tests tend to be more trustworthy as they verify functionality from the perspective of a user. A GUI component
is required to perform end-to-end tests that rely on third-party software such as Selenium that requires heavy compute time and resources.

Contract testing bridges the gap among the shortcomings of those testing methodologies. Contract testing is a technique for testing an integration point by isolating each application and checking if the
HTTP requests and responses it transmits conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a contract.
It ensures that microservices can communicate with each other.

The two microservices you will interact with are called `system` and `inventory`. The `system` microservice returns the JVM
`system` properties of its host. The `inventory` microservice retrieves specific properties from the `system` microservice. You will
learn how to use the https://docs.pact.io/[Pact^] framework to write contract tests for the `inventory` application to be verified by
the `system` application.

*Pact*

Pact is an open source contract testing tool for testing HTTP requests, responses and, message integrations by using contract tests.

*Pact broker*

The pact broker is an application for sharing pact contracts and verification results, and is an important piece for integrating pact into CI/CD pipelines.

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed. For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^]. You will deploy the pact broker application in a Docker container.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

[role="command"]
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

=== Starting pact broker

Start the pact broker application:
[role='command']
```
docker-compose -f "pact-broker/docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```

When the pact broker application is running, you will see:
[role="no_copy"]
```
Creating pact-broker_postgres_1 ... done
Creating pact-broker_pact-broker_1 ... done
```

Go to http://localhost:9292/[^] to confirm that you can access the pact broker's UI.

You can refer to the official https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/docker_images/pactfoundation[Pact Broker^]
documentation for more information about the components of the docker compose file.

== Implementing pact test in the inventory service

You can find the starting Java projects in the `start` directory. It is made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices.
Each microservice lives in its own corresponding directory; `system` and `inventory`.

Navigate to the `start/inventory` directory to begin.

The `InventoryPactIT` class contains a [hotspot=mockprovider file=0]`mock provider` that mimics the HTTP responses from the `system` microservice.
The [hotspot=pact file=0]`@Pact` annotation takes the name of the microservice as a parameter that makes it easier to differentiate microservices from one another when there are multiple applications.

The [hotspot=builder file=0]`RequestResponsePact` method defines the minimal expected response for a specific endpoint and is also known as an interaction.
For each interaction, the expected request and the response are registered with the mock service by using the [hotspot=verification file=0]`@PactVerification` annotation.

The test sends a real request to the [hotspot=mockTest file=0]`mock provider`. The mock provider compares the actual request with the expected request and confirms if the comparison is successful.
Finally, the [hotspot=unitTest file=0]`unit test` confirms that the response is correct.

The pact framework provides an [hotspot=pactPlugin file=1]`extension` that can be added to the build section of the `pom.xml`. It contains the [hotspot=endpoint file=1]`endpoint` URL for the `system` microservice and the [hotspot=pactDirectory file=1]`location` at which the pact file is to be stored.
The [hotspot=pactJunit file=1]`pact-jvm-consumer-junit` dependency provides the base test class for use with JUnit to build the unit tests.

#Replace the inventory pom file.#
`inventory/pom.xml`
----

After you create `InventoryPactIT.java` and replace the `pom.xml` file, Open Liberty automatically reloads its configuration.

A contract between `inventory` and `system` microservice is known as a pact. Each pact is a collection of interactions that are defined in the `InventoryPactIT` class.

Press the `enter/return` key to run the tests and generate the pact file.

When integrating pact in a CI/CD pipeline, the `mvn verify` goal can be used instead to generate the pact file.

The generated pact file is named `Inventory-System.json` and is located in `inventory/target/pacts`. It contains the defined interactions in `.json` format:

[role="no_copy"]
----
{
...
"interactions": [
{
      "description": "a request for os encoding entity",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/system/properties/key/os.encoding"
      },
      "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": [
          {
            "os.encoding": "UTF-8"
          }
        ]
      },
      "providerStates": [
        {
          "name": "os.encoding is UTF-8"
        }
      ]
    }
...
  ]
}
----

Open a new command-line session to publish the generated pact file to the pact broker by using:
[role='command']
```
mvn pact:publish
```

When completed, you will see something similar to:
[role="no_copy"]
```
[INFO] --- maven:4.1.0:publish (default-cli) @ inventory ---
Publishing 'Inventory-System.json' with tags 'open-liberty-pact' ... OK
```

== Verifying the pact in pact broker

Refresh the http://localhost:9292/[pact broker webpage^] to verify that a new entry was added. Note there is no
timestamp in the `Last verified` column as the pact is yet to be verified by the `system` microservice.

You can also see the http://localhost:9292/pacts/provider/System/consumer/Inventory/latest[interactions^] URL for more insights about each interaction that was created.

A snippet of the interaction page looks similar to:
[role="no_copy"]
```
A pact between Inventory and System
Requests from Inventory to System
A request for os encoding entity given os.encoding is UTF-8

A request for the version given version is 1.1

A request to check for the default directory given default directory is true

Interactions
Given os.encoding is UTF-8, upon receiving a request for os encoding entity from Inventory, with

{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/system/properties/key/os.encoding"
}
System will respond with:

{
  "status": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": [
    {
      "os.encoding": "UTF-8"
    }
  ]
}
```
== Implementing pact test in the system service

----
include::finish/inventory/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryPactIT.java[]
----

Navigate to the `start/system` directory.

Open another command-line session to start Open Liberty in dev mode for the `system` microservice:
[role=command]
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
************************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.

The connection information for the pact broker is provided with the [hotspot=connectionInfo file=0]`@PactBroker` annotation. The dependency also provides a [hotspot=invocation file=0]`JUnit5 Invocation Context Provider` to write pact verification tests that are used with the `@TestTemplate` annotation to generate a test for each of the interactions.

A `system` property is set to true for [hotspot=publish file=0]`pact.verifier.publishResults` so that the results are sent to the pact broker after the tests are completed.

The test target is defined in the [hotspot=context file=0]`PactVerificationContext` to point to the running endpoint of the `system` microservice.

The [hotspot=state file=0]`@State` annotation must match the [hotspot=given file=2]`.given()` parameter that was provided in the `inventory` test class so that pact can identify which test case to run against which endpoint.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]

#Create the SystemBrokerIT.java file.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemBrokerIT.java`

After you create the `SystemBrokerIT.java` and replace the `pom.xml` file, Open Liberty automatically reloads its configuration.

== Verifying the contract

In the command-line session where the system microservice was started, press the `enter/return` key to run the tests to verify the pact file. When integrating pact in a CI/CD pipeline, the `mvn test` goal can be used instead to verify the pact file from the pact broker.

[role="no_copy"]
```
...
Verifying a pact between pact between Inventory (1.0-SNAPSHOT) and System

  Notices:
    1) The pact at http://localhost:9292/pacts/provider/System/consumer/Inventory/pact-version/XXX is being verified because it matches the following configured selection criterion: latest pact for a consumer version tagged 'open-liberty-pact'

  [from Pact Broker http://localhost:9292/pacts/provider/System/consumer/Inventory/pact-version/XXX]
  Given version is 1.1
  a request for the version
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)
[main] INFO au.com.dius.pact.provider.DefaultVerificationReporter - Published verification result of 'au.com.dius.pact.core.pactbroker.TestResult$Ok@4d84dfe7' for consumer 'Consumer(name=Inventory)'
[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.835 s - in it.io.openliberty.guides.system.SystemBrokerIT
...
```
When completed, refresh the http://localhost:9292/[pact broker webpage^] to confirm that there is now a timestamp in the `Last verified` column.

The pact file that is created by the `inventory` microservice was successfully verified by the `system` microservice through the pact broker application.
This ensures that responses from the `system` microservice meet the expectation of the `inventory` microservice.

== Tearing down the environment

[role=command]
include::{common-includes}/devmode-quit.adoc[]

Run the following commands to remove the pact broker application.
[role='command']
```
docker-compose -f "pact-broker/docker-compose.yml" down
docker rmi postgres:12
docker rmi pactfoundation/pact-broker:2.62.0.0
docker volume rm pact-broker_postgres-volume
```

== Great work! You're done!

You implemented contract testing by using pact in microservices and verified the contract by using the pact broker.
